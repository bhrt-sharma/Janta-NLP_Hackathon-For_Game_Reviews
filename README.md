# Janta-NLP_Hackathon-For_Game_Reviews

#### I learnt a lot in this contest about NLP, and understood that the traditinal steps that are followed in the preprocessing of NLP problem is not a good idea always.


I used BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which is inspired from this paper [a link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) published by researchers at Google AI Language.
